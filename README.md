# 🔥 Hunting Exchange And Research Threat Hub (HEARTH) 🔥

<img src="HEARTH-logo.png" alt="HEARTH Logo" width="500"/>

A community-driven repository for threat hunting ideas, methodologies, and research that serves as a central gathering place for hunters to share knowledge, collaborate on techniques, and advance the field of threat hunting.

HEARTH incorporates ideas for **three distinct types** of hunts classified by the [PEAK Threat Hunting Framework](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/peak-threat-hunting-framework.html):
- **Flames**: Hypothesis-driven investigations with clear, testable hypotheses
- **Embers**: Environment baselining and exploratory analysis
- **Alchemy**: Model-assisted and algorithmic approaches to threat detection

## 🔥 Why 
Generating effective hypotheses and ideas for threat hunting is hard. HEARTH provides a collaborative environment where hunters can share, develop, and refine their methodologies while building a comprehensive knowledge base for the security community.

## 🔥 Goals 
- Encourage collaboration
- Inspire threat hunters with practical and theoretical hunting ideas
